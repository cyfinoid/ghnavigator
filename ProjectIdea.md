# Github Navigator Via ghtoken

This project should provide a html/js/css based environment which does a few things

1. gives a file browser kind of an interface which shows all the repositories that the token has access to based on different orgs it has access to. 
2. when selected it should show content of the repository (files and folder list)
3. If a specific file is selected it should show its latest version.

4. in one cornor it should keep showing a counter on how many api calls can b made more and when the limit will be reset.

User needs to provide a github token at the top and then application should do the job.
